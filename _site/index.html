        We've Been Awarded a NCWIT Amplification Award!
      </a>
    </h3>
    <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2015</span>
    <p>ACM-W @ RPI is excited to announce that we have been granted the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) Amplification Award sponsored by Google.org!
Valued at $5,000 dollars, the Amplification Award was created for existing ACM-W chapters seeking to expand their impact though both new and existing opportunities within the campus setting and the greater community.</p>

<p>With the grant, will be hosting a one-day Women in Tech Summit held on campus that will bring together ACM-W members and other women in Computer Science throughout the Capital District Region.
This summit will be modeled after the Grace Hopper Celebration with emphasis on community creation.
The summit will be an exciting place to learn, inspire, innovate and network so we hope to see you there!</p>

<p>We are grateful to NCWIT and Google.org for graciously funding our summit.
Without their financial support it would not be possible to create this opportunity.
Additionally, we are appreciative for the support provided to us via the Department of Computer Science and our advisors Dr. Fran Berman and Dr. Sibel Adali.
Their dedication to improving diversity as another means of providing a first rate education and academic experience is unrelenting.</p>
