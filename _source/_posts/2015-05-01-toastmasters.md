Whether you absolutely love public speaking or want to learn how to wow an audience then you’re going to want to attend ACM-W’s Toastmaster Event on Friday May 1st!
Please RSVP by Thursday, April 30th, at midnight.
Together we will learn to navigate the world of public speaking underneath the guidance of NYISO Toastmasters group will be providing both general instruction and feedback.

Closing the tech industry’s gender gap will require more than the stellar technical skills we are improving upon here at RPI.
Having the ability to captivate audiences, sell your ideas, and communicate with others will not only increase your upward career trajectory; but it will also attract other talented women to the field!
The evening will commence with a dessert spread at 6:00pm, followed by the beginning of our program which events at approximately 7:30pm.

RSVP [HERE](https://cammiej.typeform.com/to/qoCykI).
Please note we are looking for 2 volunteers to do a 4 to 7 minute speech and receive feedback from the NYISO group.
This is an exciting opportunity to get personalized advice on your abilities and areas of improvement.
Additionally, you may amaze the NYISO team who I am told has a wonderful internship program!
